# W2D

• Implementation of Deep Neural Networks for conversion of an Image(Design) to code.

• The main aim of this project is to generate Domain specific language(DSL) for the given wireframe.

• With the help of a Vision model and a language model, we aim to come up with a Deep Learning model capable of generating the DSL for a Graphical user interface(GUI) design.

• We perform an experimental analysis over the Pix2Code project by varying the neural network architecture, using a different convolutional neural network(CNN) architecture such as VGGNet.

• Thus, we come up with our architecture where we can implement these features in both the Language and Vision models.
